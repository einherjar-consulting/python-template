# 1 Experiments

This directory contains all the different experiments and tests for different functionality. We've added a directory called `person_detector` that would, hypothetically speaking, contain
experiments showing how to use different versions of person detectors.

# 2 Contents

* [person_detector](./person_detector)
  * This directory contains code that shows how to use different person detectors, how these can be benchmarked etc.
